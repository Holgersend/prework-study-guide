        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable we use the var keyword</li>
          <li>We give the variable a name that must be unique.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want to stored.</li>
          <li>The console.log method can be use to output a message to the web console by an argument.</li>
          <li>A truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the botom of the page.</li>
          <li>We can use conditionals and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.</li>
          <li>The if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li>The else if statement is use when we want to provide more conditions than just if.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that are related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array we use var and then give the variable a name and we assign the variable to a group os values.</li>
          <li>The for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a taskon all the items in any array.</li>
          <li>A for loop allows a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:
           fisrt statement determines the starting point for our loop, we declare a variable x and give it a values of 0.
           Second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less thanthe length of the array, the loop will keep runnning.
           Third statement is what allows the array iterate over each time (The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing).</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Math function help us select a random number. </li>
