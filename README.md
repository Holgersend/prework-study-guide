# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Curiosity and the urge of being good at something is always my motivation; This website was built under the challenge of learning a new language and  new skills that will help me complete this bootcamp. This project, along with the skills acquired over the course of the bootcamp, will provide me the knowledge that I'll need in order to succeed in the work field. 
This website holds the notes that I've take during my prework so I can have a easy acces to them any time that they are needed. I started this prework knwoing the very basics of cooding in HTML and the basic terms from computer-related termns. Through this project I aquired more knwolage about what web developers do, the steps and process that takes to create a product, including skills on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git that will allow me to complete this bootcamp.

This Prework Study Guide can be use as a "cheat sheet" that contains four sections on which each section you will find a topic like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. It includes the notes that I consider most important for each topic that I learned from the prework. I will also be able to see how the JavaScript is running and choose which topic to study first.
